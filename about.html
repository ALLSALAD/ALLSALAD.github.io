		<b>Relevance:</b> how useful the resource is likely to be to undergraduate study rated out of 5. Not a measure of quality. <br><br>
		1: Probably not useful to anyone<br>
		2: Limited use in specific situations <br>
		3: If you are researching this particlular area, it is likely to be useful.<br>
		4: Very likely to be useful to most, especially if it is in the particular area of interest<br>
		5: I think this will be very useful to the majority of students
		<br><br>
		<b>Difficulty:</b> How much prior language skill and design knowledge is needed for the resource to be useful.<br><br>
		1: Understandable with very limited English or prior design knowledge<br>
		2: Understandable with basic English<br>
		3: May contain long sections of prose but will be relatively simple.<br>
		4: Requires some previous knowledge of the topic. May use some complex language.<br>
